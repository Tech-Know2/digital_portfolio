                <p>
                    I have always been obsesed with programming ever since 5th grade. I have built scratch and unity games, websites and mobile apps. I have taken every 
                    club, class, school and non school program in order to further my skills and abilities. Programming, and learning about programming is my passion
                    and will most likely continue to be my passion until the end of time. I love how you with a couple of lines that semi resemeble english, you can create
                    something so unbelievably impactful and wonderful that it can change the lives of billions. That is the gift of technology, and that is why I have been
                    so in love with it.

                    Learning skills, languages, and platforms is wonderful and fantastic, but it is not my main goal in life. I want to leave this earth nothing that I helped
                    change the lives of billions of people for the better. I want to build the next thing that will allow billions to access resources and tools that where
                    previously unattainable to them. I want to build the next DeFi protocol to allow  3rd world nations to invest and particiapte in global commerce. I want to
                    design smarter ways to eat and travel. I want to help make change in this world, and technology will help me do so.
